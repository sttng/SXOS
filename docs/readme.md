Moral standpoints aside, no one will be able to replicate SX's XCI loading and distribute it as free open source 
software. Not because of any technical hurdles or anything, but because it's flat out illegal.

TX reversed most of the gamecard protocol from the FS sysmodule and re-implemented it in their Loader KIP, hidden 
away inside a MIPS VM and a few layers of obfuscation. However, to achieve this, TX included sectors dumped from a 
real gamecard and the gamecard controller's certificate (which can be obtained by FS using a specific command). You 
can find these binaries by unpacking SX OS and searching inside the Loader KIP (simple hex editor will do) for "CERT" 
and "LOTUS".

Basically, any form of XCI loading requires heavily patching the FS sysmodule which can be quite a task if you want 
to support all firmware versions and what not. To avoid this, TX instead applies a single patch to FS which redirects 
gamecard commands to their MIPS VM. Then, code in their VM replies to the gamecard commands issued by FS with signed 
data ripped from a real gamecard.

After the authentication process has been forged, the VM is free to read data from the SD card and send it back to FS 
each time FS sends the gamecard sector reading command.

There are a few more details which I'm saving up for the writeup (SOONâ„¢), but that's the gist of it. A free solution 
will never be able to take this path for obvious reasons (instant takedown and lawsuits galore!), so a more complex 
approach will be necessary.

    Could that solution be used if paired with the requirement that the user needs to dump their own sector data 
    from a game card? Like, include everything up to the game card sectors? It would obviously need to come with 
    a homebrew capable of doing that or does the type of dumping needed require specialized hardware or tools?


Yes, it's definitely possible. However, dumping the necessary data will require specialized tools that don't 
exist yet.Essentially, you must forge most of the gamecard controller's authentication process and then request 
these special sectors from the gamecard. I've documented all that some time ago in the wiki: 
https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Gamecard_ASIC

However, this is detectable if you go online by accident, for example. If you bought a game and used the card's 
authentication sectors for something like this, you could be tracked down fairly accurately.
